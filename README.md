Daily Gaming Spotlight

This is a simple, single-page web application that features a rotating "Game of the Day." The featured game cycles automatically every 24 hours at 00:00:00 UTC.

It is designed to be fully responsive and uses modern CSS for a dark, engaging gaming aesthetic.

Features

Live Countdown Timer: A real-time countdown shows exactly how long until the next game is revealed.

Dynamic Styling: The card border and call-to-action button color dynamically update to match the aesthetic of the current game.

Single File: The entire application (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) is contained within one file, making deployment extremely simple.
